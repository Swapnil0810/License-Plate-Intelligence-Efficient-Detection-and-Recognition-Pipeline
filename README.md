# License-Plate-Intelligence-Efficient-Detection-and-Recognition-Pipeline
Discover our powerful License Plate Intelligence projectâ€”swift detection &amp; recognition. Benefit from real-time accuracy, scalability, and easy integration. Customize for your needs, enjoy cross-platform compatibility, and join a vibrant community. Build a smarter, safer future with our efficient license plate intelligence.
The 'service.py' file encompasses the algorithm responsible for detecting and recognizing license plate numbers. 
By leveraging 'anpr_main.py,' users can integrate video feeds, whether from recorded videos or live 'RTSP' streams. 
Ensure 'sort.py' is included for vehicle tracking and 'utility.py' to access the CUDA Execution Provider, enabling hardware-accelerated computation on Nvidia CUDA-enabled GPUs. 
The 'Resources' folder includes a trained detection model, a pretrained OCR model, and an optimized ONNX model.
